## 39. Combination Sum

Given an array of **distinct** integers `candidates` and a target integer `target`, return *a list of all **unique combinations** of* `candidates` *where the chosen numbers sum to* `target`. You may return the combinations in **any order**.

The **same** number may be chosen from `candidates` an **unlimited number of times**. Two combinations are unique if the frequency of at least one of the chosen numbers is different.

The test cases are generated such that the number of unique combinations that sum up to `target` is less than `150` combinations for the given input.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: candidates = [2,3,6,7], target = 7
Output: [[2,2,3],[7]]
Explanation:
2 and 3 are candidates, and 2 + 2 + 3 = 7. Note that 2 can be used multiple times.
7 is a candidate, and 7 = 7.
These are the only two combinations.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: candidates = [2,3,5], target = 8
Output: [[2,2,2,2],[2,3,3],[3,5]]
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: candidates = [2], target = 1
Output: []
```

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= candidates.length <= 30`
*   `2 <= candidates[i] <= 40`
*   All elements of `candidates` are **distinct**.
*   `1 <= target <= 40`
```

## Solution

Okay, let's break down the Combination Sum problem.

**1. Explanation of the Problem**

The goal is to find all unique combinations of numbers from a given list (`candidates`) that add up to a specific target value (`target`). There are a few key points:

*   **Distinct Candidates:** The input array `candidates` contains unique integers.
*   **Unlimited Use:** You can use the same number from `candidates` multiple times within a single combination.
*   **Unique Combinations:** Two combinations are considered different if the count (frequency) of at least one number used is different. For example, `[2, 2, 3]` and `[2, 3, 3]` are different combinations for `target = 7` and `target = 8` respectively. The order of numbers within a combination doesn't matter for uniqueness (e.g., `[2, 2, 3]` is the same combination as `[3, 2, 2]`), but we need a consistent way to represent and generate them to avoid duplicates in the final output list.
*   **Output:** Return a list containing all these unique combinations. The order of combinations in the output list doesn't matter, and the order of numbers within each combination list doesn't matter either (though typically they are generated in non-decreasing order).

**2. Step-by-Step Approach (Backtracking)**

This problem is a classic fit for a backtracking algorithm. We explore potential combinations recursively, building them step by step.

1.  **Sorting (Optional but Recommended):** Sort the `candidates` array. This helps in two ways:
    *   It makes it easier to avoid generating duplicate combinations (like `[2, 3]` and `[3, 2]`) by ensuring we always pick candidates in non-decreasing order.
    *   It allows for an optimization: if the current candidate is already larger than the remaining target sum needed, we know that all subsequent candidates (which are even larger) will also be too big, so we can stop exploring further down that path for the current level of recursion.

2.  **Backtracking Function:** Define a recursive helper function (e.g., `backtrack`) that takes the following parameters:
    *   `remaining_target`: The amount still needed to reach the original `target`.
    *   `current_combination`: The list of numbers chosen so far for the current path.
    *   `start_index`: The index in the sorted `candidates` array from which we should start considering numbers for the next step. This is crucial to prevent duplicate combinations and permutations.

3.  **Base Cases:** Inside the `backtrack` function:
    *   If `remaining_target == 0`: We have found a valid combination. Add a *copy* of `current_combination` to our final list of results. Return.
    *   If `remaining_target < 0`: The current path has exceeded the target. This path is invalid. Return.

4.  **Recursive Step:** Iterate through the `candidates` array starting from `start_index`.
    *   For each `candidate = candidates[i]` (where `i >= start_index`):
        *   **Optimization:** If `candidate > remaining_target` (and since the array is sorted), we can `break` the loop because this candidate and all subsequent ones are too large.
        *   **Choose:** Add the current `candidate` to `current_combination`.
        *   **Explore:** Make a recursive call to `backtrack`:
            *   Pass the new remaining target: `remaining_target - candidate`.
            *   Pass the updated `current_combination`.
            *   Pass the *same* `start_index` `i`. Why `i` and not `i + 1`? Because we are allowed to reuse the *same* candidate multiple times. By passing `i`, the next recursive call can choose `candidates[i]` again.
        *   **Unchoose (Backtrack):** Remove the last added `candidate` from `current_combination`. This allows us to explore other possibilities (e.g., choosing a different candidate at the current level or choosing the same candidate fewer times).

5.  **Initialization:**
    *   Create an empty list `results` to store the valid combinations.
    *   Sort the `candidates` array.
    *   Initiate the backtracking process by calling `backtrack(target, [], 0)`.
    *   Return the `results` list.

**3. Python Solution**

**Complexity Analysis:**

*   **Time Complexity:**
    *   Sorting: O(N log N), where N is the number of candidates.
    *   Backtracking: This is harder to pin down precisely. Let T be the target value and N be the number of candidates. The depth of the recursion tree can go up to T / min(candidates). At each node, we might iterate through N candidates (though the `start` index and pruning help). In the worst case, the number of nodes explored can be exponential. A loose upper bound might be something like O(N^(T/min_candidate)).
    *   Let K be the number of valid combinations found. Copying each valid combination takes time proportional to its length (which is at most T).
    *   Given the constraints and the problem statement mentioning the number of combinations is < 150, the backtracking part, while theoretically exponential, is feasible in practice for the given constraints. The overall time complexity is dominated by the backtracking search. It's often described as exponential, roughly O(N * K) where K is the number of solutions, but the search space exploration itself can be larger. Let's denote it as roughly O(N^(Target/MinVal)) considering the branching and depth, plus the cost of generating results.
*   **Space Complexity:**
    *   O(N) for sorting if it requires auxiliary space (or O(1) if in-place).
    *   O(T / min(candidates)) or simply O(T) for the recursion call stack depth in the worst case. Each recursive call stores its state.
    *   O(T) for the `combo` list being built (maximum length is bounded by T / smallest candidate).
    *   O(K * L) for the `results` list, where K is the number of combinations and L is the average length of a combination (L can be up to T). Given K < 150, this is roughly O(150 * T).
    *   Overall auxiliary space complexity (excluding the output `results`) is dominated by the recursion depth: O(Target). If including the output, it's O(Target + K * Target) which simplifies to O(K * Target).

**4. Test Cases (Included in the Python code above)**

*   **Example 1:** `candidates = [2, 3, 6, 7], target = 7` -> `[[2, 2, 3], [7]]` (Basic case with reuse)
*   **Example 2:** `candidates = [2, 3, 5], target = 8` -> `[[2, 2, 2, 2], [2, 3, 3], [3, 5]]` (Multiple combinations, reuse)
*   **Example 3:** `candidates = [2], target = 1` -> `[]` (Target smaller than smallest candidate)
*   **Additional 1:** `candidates = [3, 5], target = 4` -> `[]` (No solution possible)
*   **Additional 2:** `candidates = [2, 4, 6], target = 6` -> `[[2, 2, 2], [2, 4], [6]]` (Target is a candidate, multiple solutions)
*   **Additional 3:** `candidates = [7, 3, 2], target = 18` (Tests sorting and slightly larger target) -> `[[2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2], [2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3], [2,2,2,2,3,7], [2,2,2,3,3,3,3], [2,2,7,7], [2,3,3,3,7], [3,3,3,3,3,3], [3,3,7,7]]`

The provided Python solution implements the backtracking strategy correctly and includes the sorting optimization. The test cases cover various scenarios described in the problem.
