# LeetCode Solutions and AI Model Analyzer

LLaMA 4 was released just a few days ago, and it brings back memories of when the LLaMA series first set out to close the gap between open-source LLMs and their proprietary counterparts. I’m especially excited to experiment with LLaMA 4 Maverick. I initially noticed that Together.ai provides an API for it, but as always, OpenRouter was quick to support the model too. Given its clean and convenient interface—and support for a wide range of models like DeepSeek and Gemini 2.5 Pro—I’ve decided to use OpenRouter for my testing.

Before diving into some toy comparisons I’ve been running, it’s worth highlighting a few key advancements. Notably, LLaMA 4 Scout supports a 10M token context window, thanks to its use of interleaved attention layers (iRope), eliminating the need for traditional positional embeddings. Readers interested in the underlying theory should check out the paper “Scalable-Softmax is Superior for Attention.” In a nutshell, scalable-softmax addresses the problem of attention fading by introducing a scaling parameter. This leads to:

Faster convergence during pretraining

Better generalization to longer contexts

Significant improvements in Needle-in-a-Haystack benchmarks.

As for the toy benchmarking repo I’m working on, it includes scripts to generate LeetCode solutions using various LLMs, along with a detailed comparison report—covering code quality, explanations, and some basic statistics.

Both DeepSeek-V3 0324 and LLaMA 4 Maverick generate reasonable results for a simple endless runner game. That said, I slightly prefer DeepSeek's UI—it even changes the background color when the player dies, which adds a nice touch of polish.
